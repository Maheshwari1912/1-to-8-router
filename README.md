**Aim of a 1-to-8 Router:**

The aim of a 1-to-8 router is to direct an input signal to one of eight possible output channels based on a control signal. 
The control signal (often called the select signal) determines which of the eight outputs will receive the input signal, while the others remain inactive or set to a default value.
